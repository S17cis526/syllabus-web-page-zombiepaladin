    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
      This course explores the standards,
      technologies, and strategies used in
      modern web application development.
      The ultimate goal is to develop the
      foundational theoretical and practical
      knowledge that will allow you to work
      with an endless variety of web stacks
      and frameworks, rather than focusing on
      a single technology or approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have a lot of ground to cover, so we
      will be moving very quickly through the
      material.  It is vital that you both keep
      up, and ask questions when you don't
      understand.  Make good use of office hours.
    </p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
      You should have completed CIS 501 with a C
      or better, and have the equivalent experience
      of CMST 135 with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      If you do not, I strongly recommend you take a
      (free) crash course on HTML & CSS through
      [https://codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com)
      or wait until you have taken CMST 135 before
      joining this course.
    </p>

    <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of this course, students should be able to:
      <ul>
        <li>Create three-tier web applications</li>
        <li>Be experienced with Agile development</li>
        <li>
          Understand and articulate the user interface
          issues, data structures, algorithms, an design
          patterns common to web development
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider the memory and computational implications
          of software designs
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop an understanding of how techniques used in
          web programing can be beneficially incorporated
           within general development efforts
        </li>
        <li>
          Be able to quickly learn web frameworks implemented
          in different languages
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Course Outline</h3>
    <p>
      The following is a general layout, and is subject
      to change:
      <ol>
        <li>HTML5, CSS3, and user agents</li>
        <li>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol</li>
        <li>ECMA Script 2015 (ES6)</li>
        <li>The Document Object Model</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
        <li>Dynamic Web Services</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>CRUD & REST</li>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>Webworkers</li>
        <li>Architectures for the Web</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>Reactive Web Apps</li>
        <li>WebSockets</li>
        <li>Embedded HTML Templates</li>
        <li>Full-Text Search</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Course Structure</h3>
    <p>
      In recognition of the importance of hands-on
      learning, this course utilizes a blended
      lecture/lab format, where theoretical understanding
      is immediately put to use programming software
      drawing upon that theoretical understanding.
      Effective learning following this strategy _depends_
      upon active participation; accordingly it is
      necessary to both attend class and participate
      in in-class activities to succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further, we will be embracing problem-based
      cooperative learning approaches at the midpoint
      of the semester where we will shift to small
      group work, developing an original and useful
      web application drawing upon the knowledge you
      have gained throughout the semester.  To help
      promote accountability, peer reviews from this
      phase will account for the equivalent of a
      letter grade.
    </p>

    <h4>Course Software</h4>

    __Node.js (for webserver development)__ [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en) Node is a fast server-side JavaScript engine based on Google's V8 JavaScript interpreter.  We will be writing our webserver using Node.

    __Atom (Integraged Development Environment)__ [https://atom.io](https://atom.io) Atom is an IDE that uses HTML5 and JavaScript as its underlying technologies, which akes it a natrual fit for web development.  You will also want the atom-html-preview package [https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview](https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview).

    __Google Chrome (Web Browser)__ https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/ Google chrome is a fast, cross-platform web browser with a robust set of developer tools.  See [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) for details.

    ### Attendance Policy
    <p>
      Each unexcused absence will reduce the student's
      class participation grade by 10%.
    </p>

    ### Late Work
    <p>
      Late work (with the exception of emergencies)
      will not be accepted.
    </p>

    ### Subject to Change
    <p>
      The details in this document are not set in stone
      - there may need to be changes made during the
      semester.  If this occurs, the changes will be
      posted to K-State Online, my personal website,
      and emailed to all students.
    </p>

    ### Academic Honesty
    Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity
    System based on personal integrity which is presumed
    to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's
    work is performed honestly and without unauthorized
    assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by
    registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
    Honor & Integrity System. The policies and procedures
    of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
    students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate
    courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance
    learning.
  </p>

    A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the [Honor Pledge](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/honorsystem/pledge.html) which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, _whether or not_ it is stated: __"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."__

    The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask

    A [grade of XF](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/faculty/xfagree.html) can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

    For more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page at: [http://www.k-state.edu/honor/](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/)

    ### Students with Disabilities

    Students with disabilities who need classroom
    accommodations, access to technology, or information
    about emergency building/campus evacuation processes
    should contact the Student Access Center and/or
    their instructor.  Services are available to students
    with a wide range of disabilities including, but not
    limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions,

    in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe
    campuses, contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu), 785-532-6441.

    ### Classroom Conduct
    All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the (Student Judicial Conduct Code)[http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/] as outlined in the Student Governing Association (By Laws)[http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf], Article V, Section 3, number 2.
